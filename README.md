# V0 Component Harness

This is a harness for v0 Components. Essentially this helps you actually deploy the component and test it out.

1. Create a component using v0 chat [(try this example)](https://v0.dev/chat?q=calculator%20that%20will%20play%20a%20%22ding%22%20sound%20when%20it%20finishes%20calculating)
2. Iterate on it using the chat
3. Paste contents in the `./src/app/v0-component.tsx` file
4. Deploy!

## Why use this?

This is a simple way to deploy and test your component. It's a good way to get started and see how your component will look in the wild. It also comes out of the box with:

- shadcn component library
- Dark Mode support
